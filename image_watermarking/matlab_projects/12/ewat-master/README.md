# Readme please:
This repo contains the Matlab watermarking toolbox as described in paper **An image watermark tutorial tool using Matlab** (http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.793308), incuding the final presenation and paper.

# Usage
Start the toolbox by starting advanced_watermarking_tool.m  (also set path+ subdirs).

# Can I steal this?
Yes , but should you wish to use/cite this code, feel free to contact us (tim.dams@ap.be) so we at least know who's toying around with this
Feel free to use this Matlab-toolbox anyway possible. Any code copied belongs to the original authors.

# Do you still update the toolbox?
No, all the authors have gone other ways. We just provide the code as-is and hope that future researchers and students can benefit from this to get started in the extraordinary world of watermarking.

# I have a great fix/addon/idea for your toolbox
Awesome. Fork it, change it and if you think your improvements are beneficial for others, feel free to send us a pull request and we'd be happy to incorporate your changes.
